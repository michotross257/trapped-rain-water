## Problem Description

Given *n* non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

## Usage
Two options:
- Jupyter Notebook (see `trapping_rain_water.ipynb`)
- Command line

To generate the image of the elevation map and the water units provide a space-separated list of integer values (e.g. *see below*)

```
$ python trapped_rain_water.py 1 0 2 3 1 2
```
